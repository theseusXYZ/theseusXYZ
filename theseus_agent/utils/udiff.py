Here are the resulting errors from applying the newest diff:

</ERRORS>

Please answer the following questions thinking step by step:

What are the exact section content lines from the src_file that the ORIGINAL_DIFF targets?
Copy, and paste this section with additional context lines EXACTLY with an additional 3 context lines on either side.

The ORIGINAL_DIFF may source code lines that have typos! These are ok to change! I inaccurately wrote the diff anyways.

Was enough context added to the original diff to make it work?
Do all source lines actually exist in the ORIGINAL_DIFF?

Are the NEWEST_DIFF lines target the lines you copied above? If not, how can you fix this?
Was enough context added to the newest diff to make it work?
Do all source lines actually exist in the NEWEST_DIFF?

Please point out all the lines that are added lines but not marked as added.
Please point out all the source lines that were accidentally marked as added.

Does the new diff only create a hunk for the content/source lines the original diff targets?

Once those questions are answered, please provide the improved diff according to the guidelines. If you get it right, I'll buy you Taylor Swift tickets.

    To resolve this issue, please generate additional context lines that match the original source code exactly.

    Keep in mind that even minor discrepancies between the context lines and the original code will prevent the diff from being applied correctly.
    In about half of these cases, the problem stems from context lines that don't precisely align with the source.

    To generate the additional lines needed:
    1. Locate the section of the source code where you want to make changes
    2. Carefully copy several lines immediately before and after the relevant section
    3. Double-check that each copied line is identical to the original source code
    4. Include these matching context lines in your diff, surrounding the lines you want to change

    The solution to fix this error is changing fewer lines to adhere to the original diff better.
