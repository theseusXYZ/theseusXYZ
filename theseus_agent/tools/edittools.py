            edit_file - apply a diff to files in the file system

    SYNOPSIS
            edit_file [DIFF]

    DESCRIPTION
            The edit_file command takes a target DIFF and applies it to files that are open
            in the file system. Someone will edit and double check your work.

            The DIFF argument is a diff string to be applied to specific files. It is similar
            to calling `diff --git "diff string"` where "diff string" is the argument you
            would pass to the edit_file command.

            You ALWAYS need to provide a source AND target file represented with `---` and `+++` even if the source is empty.

            ALWAYS make sure that the code STARTS on its own line.

    RETURN VALUE
            The edit_file command returns a dictionary of all the files that were changed.

    EXAMPLES
            To apply a diff string to open files in the file system:

                    edit_file <<<
                    --- file1.txt
